## üìå Overview

This project simulates a basic quiz game where users are presented with a series of multiple-choice (True/False) questions. The game keeps track of the user's score and displays feedback after each question.

It demonstrates object-oriented programming concepts in Python by using classes to model questions, manage the quiz logic, and handle user input/output.
