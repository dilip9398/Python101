## üìå Overview

This project is a simple *True/False quiz game*.
It reads raw quiz data from a **data source**, turns each question into a structured *quiz item*, and organizes them into a **question bank**.
A **quiz manager** then guides the player through the questions, checks answers, and tracks the score, all orchestrated by a **game runner** that sets up the game and runs the main loop.
